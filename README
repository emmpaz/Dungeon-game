Assignment 1.03

  Our task was to make a pathfinding algorithm to be able to tell which direction monsters would have to go to get to the player the fastest. We used Dijkstra's algorithm to do this. We made 2 different versions for this. One was tunnelling, which allowed the monsters to go through the walls with weighted options based on the hardness. The other one was just made for the monsters to go through the hallways.
