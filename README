Assignment 1.02

  Our task was to read in or save binary data through a structured binary file to reconstruct a dungeon with said binary data. There are two command-line arguments 
that can flag if the program will save and or load a dungeon. All integer data will be read in with specific byte sizes and converted from big-endian to host. Data written 
to file will have a similar process where it will be converted from host to big-endian. The hardness will be used to generate the border and the open spaces. Then rooms
and stairs will be added last overriding the corridors.
