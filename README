Our task was to build a dungeon that was a certain dimension that had rooms connected by corridors and at least 1 staircase going up and at least 1 going down.
This dungeon had to be random everytime we ran the code. For our solution, we started with making structs for; rooms, stairs and the dungeon. In main we first
made the rooms be random dimensions with certain boundaries. Then we randomly placed the rooms on the dungeon board and they had to be at least one space apart
from the other rooms. We then connected each room on the board with corridors by using the top left coordinate of each room and finding a path to connect them.
After having rooms and corridors, we then added stairs in a random location on the board making sure it was on a '#' or '.'. We also have borders for the dungeon.
